<p class="intro">
Back home in Southern Illinois I have an English Lab named Tucker <em>(AKA Tucker Buster Brown)</em>. Some of his hobbies include fetching golf balls, popping bubble wrap, and prancing with cardboard boxes. Tucker also has an older brother, Indy, who he loves to pester and share his time with. 
</p>
<p class="extra">
Although he is a whopping 75 pounds, Tucker believes whole heartedly that he is a lap dog and will happily make himself comfortable regardless of your own comfort! I am quite positive that there has never been a more compassionate, loving dog. <span class="important">If Tucker has taught me anything it is true friendship and the power to <strong>choose</strong> happiness.</span> If you'd like to learn a bit more about English Labs you can visit<a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/" target="_blank"> this website.</a>
